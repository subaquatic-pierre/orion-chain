# Orion Chain

## Overview

Orion Chain is a feature-rich blockchain written in Rust. It is currently in development and aims to provide a comprehensive solution for decentralized applications. One notable feature is the implementation of a custom communication protocol over TCP to facilitate communication between nodes.

## Features

- **Rust Blockchain**: A blockchain implementation in Rust.
- **Custom Communication Protocol**: Utilizes a custom communication protocol over TCP for node-to-node communication.
- **Decentralized Applications**: Aims to support the development of decentralized applications (DApps).

## Development

### Run tests

```
make test
```

### Run development server

```
make run
```

## Production

Build for production release

```
make build
```

## Communication Protocol

Orion Chain uses a custom communication protocol over TCP for node-to-node communication. Nodes in the network communicate with each other to synchronize the blockchain and propagate transactions.

## Contributing
